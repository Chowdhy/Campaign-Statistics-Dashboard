This project had the aim of learning how to design and create an application from the ground up as a software engineering team.

Our team's chosen project was an ad campaign statistics dashboard, and we chose to implement it using JavaFX and SQLite.

This project involved parsing CSV files to generate accessible databases, creating user management systems, designing for clean and aesthetic UI, and learning how to optimise database generating and access.
